# Coffee Machine

This project implements a **Finite State Machine (FSM)**. 
Three states: **IDLE**, **BREWING**, and **DISPENSING**.
The coffee machine cycles through **IDLE → BREWING → DISPENSING → IDLE**, simulating the coffee-making process.  
Outputs indicate the current state, allowing observation of brewing and dispensing stages.
